# Simples Skype Chat Style
Forked from [http://edds.github.com/Simples.SkypeChatStyle][Homepage]

## Description

Simples is a very nice chat style for Skype. It is heavily influenced by the [Renkoo][Renkoo] style for [Adium][Adium]. 

It utilises some of webkits new CSS3 which should make adding or changing any colour styles very easy. Fade-in effects are also provided by webkits CSS animation framework.

## Extra hacks

* Avatar is slightly larger
* `<code>` tags are wrapped around text that is surround with back ticks (&#96;)  
  e.g. `` `var i = 0;` `` becomes `<code>var i = 0;</code>`
